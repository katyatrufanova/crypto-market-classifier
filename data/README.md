## ⚠️ Important Note on Data Availability

**Please be aware**: The dataset used in this project is proprietary and cannot be publicly shared. The data download link has been removed from the repository (previously located in `notebooks/utils/global_config.py` under the `REMOTE_DATA` variable).

This repository is primarily for descriptive and presentation purposes. While the code and documentation are available for review, **users will not be able to run the code or reproduce the results without access to the proprietary dataset**.
